## Welcome to [BikariArchive](https://bikari.top)

Hi, I'm <ruby>KazariEX<rt>Yamabukiiro Mimori</rt></ruby>, a front-end enthusiast driven by my interests, enjoy reading light novels and listening HDM.

I primarily use Vue and Nuxt for developing.

Since I hardly speak any English, so I mostly rely on LLM for translation. Please be understanding of my grammatical issues.
